The Iowa and its sister ships, the battleships Missouri, New Jersey and Wisconsin, were commissioned during World War II and mothballed after the Korean War.
But Navy teams who entered the turret immediately after the blast found the No. 2 gun's breech open and undamaged, with the practice projectile that the gun was to have fired still there, The New York Times reported Sunday.
There were 11 survivors inside the turret, all on the lowest deck where they were loading powder from the ship's magazines, the Navy said .
The tape was made by an officer on the bridge of the Iowa who wanted to record the firing of the big guns.
The Iowa sailed to Roosevelt Roads Navy Base in Puerto Rico to unload the bodies, which were then flown to Delaware.
The bodies of 47 sailors killed in the gun explosion on the Iowa arrived in the United States on Thursday as the Navy tried to figure out what caused the battleship's turret to blow up.
The families of the victims were invited, but Navy officials said they did not know how many would attend .
Six 110-pound sacks of powder are rammed into each gun after it is loaded with a 1,900-pound shell.
