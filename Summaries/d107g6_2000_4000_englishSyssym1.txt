Here is a state-by-state summary of drought developments Wednesday:
Thunderstorms hit Brown County with heavy rain and hail that damaged drought-stricken crops.
Despite the recent rain, communities with dried-up water supplies continue to restrict water use.
Extremely heavy rain fell Tuesday in sections of Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Arkansas.
Thirty tons of Oregon hay arrived by jet in Louisville, courtesy of United Parcel Service.
The most severely hit crops are coarse grains _ mostly maize, barley and oats, the report said.
Besides fossil fuels, the depletion of forests in South America has been blamed for the increase of carbon dioxide and methane.
Heavy rain deluged some drought-hit areas as Congress began working on a package of relief for America's farmers, and farmers in Kentucky today greeted the arrival of the first shipment of hay airlifted free from Oregon.
And some states in the center of the area, stretching from West Virginia to Nebraska and from Wisconsin to Missouri, may be even drier.
That puts the current drought on the same level as the one in 1911, but still less severe than the droughts of 1936, 1931, 1956 and 1934 .
