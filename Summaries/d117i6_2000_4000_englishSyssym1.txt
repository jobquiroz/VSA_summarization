The Booker Prize is sponsored by Booker, an international food and agriculture business, and administered by The Book Trust.
The shortlist for the Booker, the UK's most hyped literary prize and one of the most lucrative, is all the more surprising in a bumper year for new fiction fulfilling the criteria - English language and non-American - for consideration for the award.
Last year's winner, Roddy Doyle's Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha, sold 350,000 copies.
``British publishers are very secretive about their sales but we know that when Thomas Keneally won it in 1982 for `Schindler's Ark,' his publishers, who had printed 15,000 copies, sold 75,000 over the next 23 weeks,'' said Christine Shaw of Book Trust.

The shortlist of six for the Pounds 20,000 Booker Prize for fiction, announced yesterday, immediately prompted the question 'Who'? from many in the publishing industry.
The five judges deliberated two hours before awarding the $39,000 prize to Antonia Byatt for ``Possession,'' one of six finalists in the 21-year-old competition.
But even if Hollinghurst wins the Booker, his novel will not become the succes de scandale of Esther Waters and Trilby, which became the bestselling novel of the 19th century.
