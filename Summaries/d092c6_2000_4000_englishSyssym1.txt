Iran said today that it would welcome relief offered by its bitter enemy, the United States, to help victims of the earthquake that has killed as many as 35,000 people, the State Department said in Washington .
The Armenian quake was measured at 6.9 on the Richter scale, but Thursday's earthquake shook the earth with a magnitude of 7.7.
Like Thursday's earthquake in Iran, the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake in Armenia killed about 25,000 people.
At least 50,000 people were reported killed and 200,000 injured in the earthquake that struck Thursday.
Another plane carrying U.S. government aid was due today.
The 7.7-magnitude quake was the largest ever recorded in that area, where two major plates of the earth's crust meet, Needhams said.
