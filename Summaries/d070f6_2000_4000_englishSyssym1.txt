Honecker, 77, was detained after his release from East Berlin's Charite hospital, where he had undergone surgery for a malignant kidney tumor, the official ADN news agency said.
Honecker joins other members of his ousted Politburo already in prison awaiting trial.
Honecker and Erich Mielke, head of East Germany's once-feared secret police agency, were interrogated by federal prosecutors, said Peter Przybylski, a Justice Ministry spokesman.
Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker was arrested and taken to prison today, and a prosecutor said he will tried for high treason in March.
East Germany's ousted secret police chief threatened to break former Communist leader Erich Honecker's neck when the two faced each other in jail, a West German newspaper reported Wednesday.
However, Seidel said that the investigation was not far enough along to determine whether charges could be filed against Honecker before East Germany merges with West Germany on Oct. 3.
On Sunday, West Germany's mass-circulation Bild newspaper said Honecker would be arrested, but that he would be held at a prison hospital because of his condition.
All three had been members of the ruling Politburo under Honecker.
