"All we can do is wait," he said.
"This could be only the beginning," said Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology.
That is what killed 38 people in Japan last week.
Seismologists said the volcano had plenty of built-up magma and even more severe eruptions could come later.
The last major eruption occurred in 1965, when the Taal volcano, about 50 miles south of Manila, exploded.
After sunset, the volcano spewed two streams of orange, glowing material from its crater in what scientists thought was the first appearance of lava during the weeklong eruptions.
At least four people have died, 24 have been hurt and four have been listed as missing since Pinatubo began erupting Sunday, after lying dormant for six centuries, officials said.
Mercury News wire services contributed to this report.
"The crisis has not ended yet," said Punongbayan, of the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology.
On clear days they fly above the crater to measure sulfur emissions.
