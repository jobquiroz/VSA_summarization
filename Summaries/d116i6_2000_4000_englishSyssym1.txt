The orbit was dictated by the need to put the telescope above the Earth's distorting atmosphere.
The next milestone is Friday, when the telescope's 10-foot aperture door is to be opened, exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight.
The telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983 but was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident.
The shuttle is scheduled to land Sunday at 9:49 a.m. EDT at Edwards Air Force Base in California.
The telescope is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding.
Then on Tuesday, NASA expects to release the first image from the telescope: an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.
Discovery was 380 miles above Earth, 70 miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown.
It started providing power to the telescope's batteries, which otherwise had only eight hours of charge.
A third attempt rolled the panel out all the way.
