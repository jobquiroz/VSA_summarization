John Major to Become British Prime Minister Succeeding Thatcher
John Major, who was endorsed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as her successor and heir, was elected today as leader of the Conservative Party and will become prime minister .
It will be difficult for John Major to lead the Tories in the next general election; therefore, news spread earlier this year that John Major would be replaced.
To show you what I mean, I spoke yesterday to John Major and John Smith.
We are going to unite totally and absolutely and we\'re going to win the next general election," said Major, who emerged smiling from his residence at 11 Downing St .
Major was elected to Parliament in 1979, was appointed foreign secretary and then chancellor of the Exchequer last year .
Major fell two votes short of the needed majority, but his opponents conceded defeat and Conservative Party officials declared him elected .
``It is a very exciting thing to become leader of the Conservative Party, and particularly exciting, I think, to follow one of the most remarkable leaders the Conservative Party has ever had,'' Major said.
