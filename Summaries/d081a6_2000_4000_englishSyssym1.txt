In the Karaganda region of the southern republic of Kazakhstan, the Soviet Union's third-biggest coal-producing area, all 26 mines were at a standstill, and miners made more than 70 demands, Izvestia said.
Some of the 150,000 miners who went on strike last week in Siberia's Kuznetsk coal basin region returned to work Thursday, and the rest went back today, strike leaders and the official Tass news agency said.

The strike initially would cover more than half of South Africa's gold mines and about one-fifth of its coal mines, said Cyril Ramaphosa, the union's general secretary.
The strike committee issued a communique today saying the workers would not end their stoppage until their demands are met and charged: ``The mine management is trying to end the strike by hunger''.

Solidarity spokeswoman Katarzyna Ketrzynska said workers on the overnight shift at the Manifest Lipcowy mine stayed outside the mine shaft all night and were joined by workers arriving for the morning shift.
He said the miners would hold the government to its word: ``If the government doesn't keep its promises, we will go back on strike''.
