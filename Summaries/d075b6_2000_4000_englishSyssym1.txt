The blood portion of the test determines whether the kidneys are releasing renin into the blood stream and how active the chemical is.
The Cornell cardiologist has argued that in many people with high blood pressure the activity of the renin in the blood is much higher than is warranted by the amount of salt in the blood.
Such "high renin" people are at a high risk of a heart attack.
An intestinal operation to lower the cholesterol of heart attack patients reduced their risk for another heart attack or death from heart disease, researchers said today.
Only 12% of the patients had high renin "profiles".
To put it another way: Of the 2,127,000 American who died that year, more than one in three died of heart disease.
Researchers at the University of Michigan recently determined that some heart attack victims can be released from the hospital as soon as three days after their heart attacks.
In the 1950s, doctors often recommended that patients stay in bed for one to two months after a heart attack.
